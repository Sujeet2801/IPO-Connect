    question: "What is an IPO?",
    answer:
      "IPO or the Initial Public Offering is the first time a company issues its shares to the public. As an investor, you will now be able to subscribe for such shares, which was earlier open to only a specific lot of internal and institutional investors via opening a Demat account.",
  },
  {
    question: "How to invest in an IPO?",
    answer:
      "To invest in an IPO, open a brokerage account, research the company, check for eligibility, place an order during the IPO offering period, and follow through once shares are listed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the benefit of an IPO?",
    answer:
      "An IPO allows a company to raise capital by selling shares to the public, helping fund expansion, pay off debt, or invest in new projects. It also provides liquidity for existing shareholders, enhances the company's public profile, and can potentially lead to increased credibility and growth opportunities.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the disadvantages of an IPO?",
    answer:
      "The disadvantages of an IPO include high costs, such as underwriting fees and legal expenses. It also requires ongoing regulatory compliance and financial reporting, which can be burdensome. The company loses some control due to public shareholder influence, and stock price volatility can affect the company's reputation.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between book building issue and fixed price issue?",
    answer:
      "A book building issue determines the price through a bidding process based on demand, while a fixed price issue sets the price in advance without investor input.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it mandatory to have a PAN number to apply in an IPO?",
    answer:
      "Yes, it is mandatory to have a PAN (Permanent Account Number) to apply for an IPO in India, as it is required for identification and tax purposes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I apply for an IPO without a Demat account?",
    answer:
      "No, having a Demat account is essential to apply for an IPO in India, as the shares are credited electronically to the applicant’s Demat account.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if I got an IPO allotment?",
    answer:
      "You can check your IPO allotment status on the registrar’s website (e.g., Link Intime or KFintech), through your broker, or via email/SMS if you’re allotted shares.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don’t get an IPO allotment?",
    answer:
      "If shares are not allotted to you, your application amount will be refunded to your bank account, typically within a few working days after allotment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can IPO shares be sold immediately after listing?",
    answer:
      "Yes, IPO shares can be sold on the stock exchange once they are listed, usually on the listing day itself. However, investors may choose to hold for long-term gains.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cut-off price in an IPO?",
    answer:
      "The cut-off price is the final issue price decided by the company in a book-built IPO. Retail investors can choose the 'cut-off' option to increase the chances of allotment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are IPO investments risky?",
    answer:
      "Yes, IPOs carry risks. Prices may be volatile after listing, and the company’s future performance is not guaranteed. It's important to research thoroughly before investing.",
  },
